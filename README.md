# Learning Management System [LMS]

![diagram](./image/diagram.png)
A Software application for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting and delivery of educational courses or training programs.They help the instructor deliver material to the students and other assignments, track student progress, and manage record-keeping. LMSs are focused on online learning delivery but support a range of uses, acting as a platform for fully online courses, as well as several hybrid forms, such as blended learning and flipped classrooms. LMSs can be complemented by learning technologies such as a training management system to manage instructor-led training or a Learning Record Store to store and track learning data.

## üí° Purpose

An LMS delivers and manages instructional content, and typically handles student registration, online course administration, and tracking, and assessment of student work. Some LMSs help identify progress towards learning or training goals. Most LMSs are web-based, to facilitate access. LMSs are often used by regulated industries (e.g. financial services and biopharma) for compliance trainingüíª.

## üèÅ What Are The Benefits of an LMS?

- The more obvious benefits of an LMS include the development of knowledge amongst students or employees. But let‚Äôs dig a little deeper into why an LMS is so useful.
- First, an LMS gives an organization somewhere to centrally house its training and development content. It can be stored, managed, edited and deleted from within the same software.
- An LMS also saves money, since traditional forms of training like seminars or training days directly impact the company‚Äôs bottom line.
- With an LMS, learners can access their eLearning environment from anywhere, at any time, at their own pace and without draining additional company resources or incurring travel expenses.

## ‚úÖ How Does an LMS Work?

- To experience the way an LMS works, let‚Äôs take a look at a very basic example of how an LMS can be deployed.
A company wants to educate its sales team about a soon-to-be-launched product.
- To do that, they use the course builder function within their LMS to create slides, bite-sized documentation, quizzes and certifications. Once the course materials are ready, each member of the sales team can log into the LMS with their own personalized account to begin learning (and now you know where the term eLearning came from).
- When an employee feels ready, he or she can take the quizzes or tests required to achieve their certification ‚Äî proving that they‚Äôre qualified to sell the product at the standard required.
The LMS can track the progress of each employee, so administrators can see how well learners are moving through the course material, who has qualified, and who remains confused about the topic.
